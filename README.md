Jquery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 12 hours_

This app allows you to add employees and see how much it will cost monthly to pay them.

### Prerequisites

None

## Installation

Open the index.html file in your web browser and you are good to go!

## Usage

Someone would use this app by entering employee information into the input fields, generating a table which keeps all entered employee information. An updated company monthly cost is displayed below the table, alerting the user when total monthly costs are greater than $20,000. Employees may also be deleted from the table, removing their monthly salary cost from the total monthly cost.
